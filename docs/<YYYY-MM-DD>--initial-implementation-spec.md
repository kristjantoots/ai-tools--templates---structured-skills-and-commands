# Implementation Spec

<!--
This tracks implementation progress. Focus on WHAT was done and decisions made.
Update this document as you work through each phase.
Replace <YYYY-MM-DD> in filename with actual date when creating.
-->

**Created:** <YYYY-MM-DD> | **Status:** In Progress

Based on: [Initial Implementation Plan](./<YYYY-MM-DD>--initial-implementation-plan.md)

---

## Decisions Made

<!--
Track key decisions and when they were made.
Start with open questions from the plan, add decisions as you go.
-->

| Question | Decision | Date |
|----------|----------|------|
| <Question from plan> | _TBD_ | - |
| <Question from plan> | _TBD_ | - |

## Prerequisites

<!--
Setup tasks before main implementation.
Use stable 4-character IDs for each item (helps with references).
-->

- [ ] `a1b2` Bun runtime installed
- [ ] `c3d4` <api-provider> API key obtained
- [ ] `e5f6` Project initialized with `bun init`
- [ ] `g7h8` Dependencies installed: `<primary-dependency>`

---

## Phase 1: <Phase Name>

<!--
Each phase from the plan gets a section.
Checkboxes track individual tasks.
Notes section captures discoveries and decisions.
-->

- [ ] `i9j0` <Task 1>
- [ ] `k1l2` <Task 2>
- [ ] `m3n4` <Task 3>

**Notes:**
```
<!-- Add notes as you work through this phase -->
```

## Phase 2: <Phase Name>

- [ ] `o5p6` <Task 1>
- [ ] `q7r8` <Task 2>

**Notes:**
```
```

---

## Phase 3: <Phase Name>

- [ ] `s9t0` <Task 1>
- [ ] `u1v2` <Task 2>

**Notes:**
```
```

---

## Phase 4: <Phase Name>

- [ ] `w3x4` <Task 1>
- [ ] `y5z6` <Task 2>

**Notes:**
```
```

---

## Phase 5: Claude Code Commands

<!--
Command implementation is typically the final phase.
Only start after the core workflow is validated.
-->

- [ ] `aa11` Design command interface
- [ ] `bb22` Implement strategy command
- [ ] `cc33` Implement generate command
- [ ] `dd44` Implement review command
- [ ] `ee55` Implement iterate command
- [ ] `ff66` Implement finalize command
- [ ] `gg77` Implement resume command
- [ ] `hh88` Test complete workflow

**Notes:**
```
```

---

## Validation Checklist

<!--
Final checks before considering implementation complete.
-->

- [ ] `ii99` End-to-end workflow tested with real API
- [ ] `jj00` Error handling tested for common failures
- [ ] `kk11` Session resumption works correctly
- [ ] `ll22` Documentation matches actual behavior
- [ ] `mm33` Cost estimates verified
